## Learning C
This repo is a collection of assignments and mini-programs/projects for beginners trying to learn C. Try to complete each task without looking at the solution! I am not a programmer by any means and a lot of this code will be trash. None of this is meant to be comprehensive or an alternative to hard work, enjoy!

## NOTE
Thanks to @h0mbre for this! I forked this to work on the exercises and learn to C
